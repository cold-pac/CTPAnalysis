# Analysis of Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) MRI

## Introduction
Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) MRI imaging is an important functional imaging method that enables quantitative assessment of tissue hemodynamic patterns. Abnormality of blood flow, volume and permeability is frequently observed during tumor growth, and characterization of these perfusion attributes has become clinically important for both diagnosis and therapy planning. In the context of glial neoplasms, perfusion characteristics have been shown to correlate with tumor type and grade and hence influence treatment decisions.

## Functionality
* Estimation of quantitative parameters(rCBV,rCBF and MTT) from DSC MRI.
* Guide diagnosis, prognosis and therapy planning.
* Brain Tumor, Stroke, Adrenoleukodystrophy and other diseases.
